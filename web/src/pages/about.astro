All data is stored in 
[\`awesome-privacy.yml\`](https://github.com/mpinac/bsh-sv-awesome-security/blob/main/awesome-privacy.yml).

This file is then pulled into the website at build-time, and also used to generate
the repositories README file.
We use this method in the interest of transparency and data integrity,
as Git makes it possible to maintain a full log of what was changed, when, by who and why.

### Augmention
The data is augmented with some extra info, to add additional context to each service.
The aim of this is to give you a broader picture of each listing, to help you make a more informed decision.
Currently, this extra data is pulled from:

- **GitHub API** - To fetch info about each project's repository
	- Including author & contributors, creation & last updated date, languages, license and star count
- **Web Check** - To fetch info about each project's website
	- Including SSL chain, WHOIS, server location, blacklist check and a screenshot
- **ToS;DR** - To fetch a summerized version of each services Privacy Policy
	- Including policy and terms of service links, postives + negatives and privacy score
- **User Reviews** - User-submitted comments + feedback on a given service
	- Implemented using self-hosted instance of Remark42
- **Portainer Templates** - To fetch info about each project's Docker image (if it's self-hosted)
	- Including supported architectures, run command, pull count, last updated and config options
`;

const projectRequrements = `
For software to be included in this list, it must meet the following requirements: 

- **Privacy Respecting**
	- The project must respect users privacy, not collect more data than necessary, and store info securely
	- For hosted services, the project must have a clear privacy policy
	- The user must remain in full control of their data, and be able to delete it at any time
- **Secure**
  - The software must be secure by default, without requiring additional configuration
  - There should be no current, critical security issues
  - The handling of past issues must have been prompt, transparent and effective
  - Ideally hosted services should have been security audited, with the report published publicly
- **Open Source**
	- The full source code should be released under an open source license
	- Ideally it should be possible for the user to build and run/deploy the software themselves from source
- **Actively Maintained**
  - The developers should address dependency updates and security patches in a timely manner
  - Ideally the source should have been updated within the last 12 months 
- **Transparent**
  - It should be clear who is behind the project, what their motives are, and what (if any) the funding model is
  - For hosted solutions, the privacy policy should clearly state what data is collected, how it's used and how long it's stored
- **Ethical**
  - Must not suppress free speech, discriminate or disregard any human rights
- **Relevant**
	- The software must be relevant, and fit into one of the existing categories
- **Functional**
	- Must be fully functional, and not just a concept or idea
	- A stable (non-alpha/beta) release is required at a minimum
	- Must be accessible to the general public, and not just a select group of people
	- If technical knowledge is required to run it, the software must be well documented

_There may be some exceptions, but these would need to be fully justified, reviewed
by the community, and the drawbacks / anti-features must be clearly listed along-side the software.
Usually these entries go within the "Notable Mentions" section instead._

		<p>
			Large data-hungry corporations dominate the digital world but with little,

			We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right and that it should be protected.

			Migrating to open-source applications and those with a strong emphasis on
			privacy & security will help safegaurd you from corporations,
			governments, and hackers who log, store or sell your sensetive personal data.

			Awesome Privacy is a directory of alternative software which respects your privacy.
